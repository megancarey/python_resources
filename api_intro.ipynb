We will be using it to gather data, and then in coming weeks we will learn how to parse through it and visualize it."

    "**URL: Uniform Resource Location**\n",
    "\n",
    "A URL is a string of characters that, when interpreted via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), points to a data resource, notably files written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) or a subset of a database. To specify what information you want to access from an API, you add parameters to the end of the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) Methods/Verbs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The GET method requests a representation of a data resource corresponding to a particular URL. The process of executing the GET method is often referred to as a “GET request” and is the main method used for querying RESTful databases. This is what we'll be using to retrieve data from APIs. Most web APIs will give you a base URL to which you can add parameters to refine your query. If you see a URL with a question mark in the middle followed by a bunch of words with equals signs, those are GET parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the base URL supplied by the Yelp API to search for businesses is:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://api.yelp.com/v2/search\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to search for where you can get Thai food in Berkeley, the URL would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://api.yelp.com/v2/search?term=Thai&location=Berkeley\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, there are two parameters:\n",
    "* The search *term* with the value Thai\n",
    "* The *location* with the value Berkeley\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the GET method, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE are other common HTTP methods, though mostly never used for database querying, so we won't worry about them for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**JSON: JavaScript Object Notation**\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a format for structuring and exchanging data. Its syntax is based on JavaScript, but you can still use it in any language, including Python. Its format is somewhat similar to that of a Python dictionary in that it consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Here's a link to the documentation for the Python library we'll be using: https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html.\n",
